**NOTES.vim**

This is a custom syntax for files with the suffix.notes

I use these filetypes to take private notes that include:

* Header boxes
* IP addresses
* Temporary username and passwords
* bulleted lists

This syntax file highlights these and includes some character concealment (Vim >=7.3 needed)
